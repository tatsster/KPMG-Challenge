## Running the code
### Libraries

Please make sure that you have the following libraries installed in your system-
- numpy
- matplotlib
- networkx
- nltk
- sklearn
- PyPDF2
- pymupdf
- fpdf

You may be confused with 3 packages for handling PDF file. All 3 are for PDF but for different purposes:
- PyPDF2: is consider to the easiest way to read PDF
- pymupdf: is the only way to highlight annotation in PDF
- fpdf: can be replaced with **pymupdf** for write PDF from blank
